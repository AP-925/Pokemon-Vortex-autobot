A very simple python script to automate battle grinding on online rpg Pokemon Vortex v4.3.22 using pyautogui.

Note :

- Set battle page's zoom to 50%
- Keep the pokemon to be trained on slot 1 in your team.
- In line 5-10 in the script, you can change the coordinates of those buttons on screen according to your screen resolution.
- These 3 buttons (first continue button, attack button and rebattle opponent button) have fixed positions on screen everytime, the another continue button after clicking attack has variable position.
- Keep the battle window open in browser, open command prompt and type python PV_.py to run. (Make sure you have python installed on your computer)

Hope you got a decent internet connection, also hope you don't get banned for cheating :P (rare case though, as there isn't any web page parsing which can be traced by admin.)

Suggestions are welcome :)
